# Packet Forwarding Devices: Types and Implementations

---

## Elements of a PFD

### Ports
* Packets are sent & received over them
* Can have different speeds from a few Mb/s to Tb/s
* Different transmission media, cable, fiber, wireless
* Different physical layer implementation

### Decision logic

Processes the packets (typically the header fields) and decides what to do with
them. In many cases processing is done in a sequence of rule tables lookup
operations known as pipeline. Needs to work at wire speed.

A PFD would in general have more than one of the following in its decision
logic:

* Ethernet Switching
* LPM 'routing': The destination address is checked against the routing table
  entries, which contains prefixes. The longest match is selected.
* ACL and Firewalls: Allow or deny service depending on rules (user
  permissions, ports and addresses, etc.)

Another alternative is to have a generic tablebased processing as proposed in
SDN (Openflow, P4)

The following shows an example pipeline:

* Parsing packets to extract the information in the headers
* Check tables to obtain actions to be applied to the packet
* Commonly done on ingress and egress

end
```

### Fabric

The *Fabric* moves the packets from the input to the output port. It can be as
simple as a shared memory, or quite complex.

### Buffers

The *buffers* store the packets until decisions are made (input) and/or until
they are sent (output). There are shared buffers and per-port buffers

### Scheduling
* Decides when to send the packet to enforce QoS

### Control and Management
* Configures the decision logic, buffers, etc
* Implements the control plane functionality for example routing protocols or
  SDN agents
* Processes packets that cannot be handled by the data plane or that have the
  PFD as source/destination

### Telemetry
* Gathers data of packets and traffic
* Increasingly important for network monitoring
* Example: defending against DoS attacks

## Virtual Routers

Implemented in Software and used in Virtual Environments

A number of libraries and tools are used to achieve good performance in terms
of latency and packet per second (pps)

* Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)
* Open Data Plane (ODP)
* Vector Packet Processing (VPP)

## Requirements and characteristics of a PFD

### Number of ports and speeds

* Determines the amount of traffic that we need to process
* Combined with the minimum packet size gives the worst-case number of packets
  per second (pps) that will be handled by the device
* The number of ports ranges from just a few to hundreds
* The speeds also vary from a few Mb/s to hundreds of Gb/s, soon Tb/s

#### Performance of Routers

The performance of a router is stated in terms of **throughput** expressed in
b/s.

However, as routers forward packets, it is sometimes more important to
know how many packets they are capable of forwarding in a second: **packets per
second** (pps)

$$
T = P × R
$$
* T = throughput
* P = # of ports
* R = line rate of each port

$$
R = S × pps
$$

 S = packet size. Use smallest size (40 bytes in a TCP ACK) or typ. 64 B
 Ps = packets per
second

$$
T = P×S×pps
$$

### Processing complexity and flexibility

What do we need to do with the packets?

The **complexity** can be as simple as Ethernet switching with only a few MAC
addresses, or as complex as:
* Looking up in an Internet scale routing table with more than 800K entries
  (https://bgp.potaroo.net/as6447/)
* Performing an Access Control List (ACL) check against thousands of rules
* Tracking existing connections as in NAT
* Performing classification on many packet fields as in SDN

The case can be worse when several of the above are combined

#### Flexibility

* Fixed pipeline that applies the same processing to all packets
* Configurable pipeline that allows a set of predefined functions to be
  composed to process packets
* Software defined processing that implements a generic set of packet
  processing primitives that can be used to define the processing

Flexibility vs speed

* In general hardware is fast, software is slow
* Software is flexible, hardware is not

### Modularity

Modularity has an impact on cost, but helps with:

* Reliability and availability (redundant modules, module swap)
* Capacity growth (adding ports)
* Adding new features

It is commonly used in large devices

### Availability

* What are the effects of the device failure?
    * Service degradation/failure
    * Number of users affected
    * Services affected

* Is it critical for some network devices/functions?
    * Use redundant modules or even devices
    * Handle failures at network level (re-routing)
    * Adding new features

* Cost/Benefit analysis
    * Improving availability has a cost
    * Failures have also a cost

### Cost

Cost is always important. It is driven by:

* Research and Development
* Bill of Materials (BoM)
* Marketing and sales

Integration lowers costs:

* System on Chip (SoC) if there is enough volume
* Reduces PCB size
* Reduces power consumption and associated costs
* Initiatives to define common platforms for packet processing devices
