## Comparing PS and CS

### How data is handled by switches in an ideal scenario

* **TDM CS**:
* **PS**:

### Implications on max concurrently-served users

* **TDM CS**: Limited concurrent users
* **PS**: Unlimited concurrent users, but with total bandwidth divided

### Concept of bottleneck and best-effort delivery

* **TDM CS**: There is a limit to the maximum number of users
* **PS**: Bandwidth per user is limited as concurrent users increase
